INGREDIENTS
Serves: 8
METRICCUPS
FOR THE SPONGE
•	50 grams walnut pieces
•	225 grams caster sugar
•	225 grams soft unsalted butter (plus some for greasing)
•	200 grams plain flour
•	4 teaspoons instant espresso powder
•	2½ teaspoons baking powder
•	½ teaspoon bicarbonate of soda
•	4 large eggs
•	1 - 2 tablespoons milk
FOR THE BUTTERCREAM FROSTING
•	350 grams icing sugar
•	175 grams soft unsalted butter
•	2½ teaspoons instant espresso powder (dissolved in 1 tablespoon boiling water)
•	approx. 10 walnut halves (to decorate)
METHOD
1.	Preheat the oven to 180°C/160°C Fan/gas mark 4/350°F.
2.	Butter two 20cm / 8inch sandwich tins and line the base of each with baking parchment.
3.	Put the walnut pieces and sugar into a food processor and blitz to a fine nutty powder.
4.	Add the 225g/2 sticks butter, flour, 4 teaspoons espresso powder, baking powder, bicarb and eggs and process to a smooth batter.
5.	Add the milk, pouring it down the funnel with the motor still running, or just pulsing, to loosen the cake mixture: it should be a soft, dropping consistency, so add more milk if you need to. (If you are making this by hand, bash the nuts to a rubbly powder with a rolling pin and mix with the dry ingredients; then cream the butter and sugar together, and beat in some dry ingredients and eggs alternately and, finally, the milk.)
